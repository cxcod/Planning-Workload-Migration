# Profiling your Workloads - draft

Perform detailed analysis on the potential cloud candidates identified in the portfolio.

## Guidance

The purpose of a detailed assessment is to gain a deep enough understanding of each application to determine whether, and if so how, its functionality should be provided in the cloud. This process involves examining existing applications from a number of different perspectives, including:

* Workload characteristics, such as elasticity, scalability, resource intensiveness, latency, and throughput)
  Architecture characteristics, such as UI complexity, device compatibility, application complexity, application life 
  expectancy, requirements for use of structured and unstructured data,  and life expectancy of existing hardware
* Financial characteristics, including the operating cost of the existing application (for many organizations this will be
  an estimate, based on peer data or sampling).
* Risk characteristics, including organizational risk, business criticality, technical risk, resource risks and      
  contractual risks.
* Operations characteristics, such as requirements for business continuity, tools to support the application, and ease of 
  deployment.
* Security and compliance considerations, such as requirements associated with data jurisdiction, regulatory compliance, 
  privacy, and encryption.

## Preparation - long section

For each workload being assessed gather the following information:Â 

  1. Capability - e.g. CRM, ERP, HR, etc.
	
  2. Name of workload

  3. Business Owner name

  4. Technical Owner name

  5. Workload characteristics - for each workload assign a value for each of the criteria below
     
     Elasticity - the ability to dynamically provision and de-provision resources to match the demand.
     1 = Low (Consistent load)
     2 = Med Low (Moderate spikes regularly)
     3 = Med (Moderate spikes occasionally)
     4 = Med High (Severe spikes regularly)
     5 = High (Severe spikes occasionally) 

     Scalability - the ability to add new resources as required.
     1 = Consistent Load
     2 = Slow, Linear Growth
     3 = Fast, Linear Growth
     4 = Known Exponential Growth
     5 = Forecasted Exponential Growth with Unknown Dates and Growth

     Resource Intensiveness - the amount of compute load of the application.
     1 = Informational
     3 = Single dimension analysis
     5 = Multi-dimensional analysis such as required by certain scientific capabilities

     Latency - the time required to perform some action or to produce some result.
     1 = Greater than 500ms
     2 = Less than 500ms
     3 = Less than 200ms (Consumer web application)
     4 = Less than 100ms
     5 = High Performance Computing (<1ms)

     Throughput - the number of such actions executed or results produced per unit of time
     1 = Less than 1 Mbps
     2 = 1-5 Mbps
     3 = 5-25 Mbps
     4 = 25-50 Mbps
     5 = Greater than 100 MBps (Multi-media and gaming)
     
  6. User Interface Architecture - for each workload assign a value for each of the criteria below
    
    Complexity - Number of custom user interface pages determines the complexity of the UI
    1 = All Custom, Branded Pages (>50) & Navigation (Many wizards, branded buttons and links)
    3 = Some Custom Pages (~30) & Navigation (A few buttons, but mostly standard)
    5 = Standard COTS (All Standard)   
    
    Access Points - The more access points required the greater the benefit of going to the cloud
    1 = No Mobile or Offline Requirements
    3 = Partial Mobile and Offline Requirements
    5 = Full Mobile and Offline Requirements

  7. Architecture (Application) - for each workload, assign a value for each of the criteria below

    Application Complexity - Number of integrations with other applications and number of tiers determines the complexity of the app.
    1 = High (N tier simple application, high integration w apps (10+))
    2 = Med High, (N tier, med integration w/other apps (5-10))
    3 = Med, (N tier,  low integration w/other apps (2-5))
    4 = Med Low, (UI with database backend)
    5 = Low, (UI stand-alone application)

    Application Size - The greater the lines of code the more difficult it is to migrate.
    1 = Greater than 250k Lines of Code
    2 = 100k-250k LOC
    3 = 25k-100k LOC
    4 = 5k-25k LOC
    5 = Less than 5k LOC

    Application Life Expectancy - The shorter the life expectancy the greater the advantages of moving to the cloud. Here,we are considering app life expectancy in terms of the technologies that are used to build the app; if those technologies are nearing end of support (e.g. Windows 2008), then they are ripe for moving to the cloud.

    1 = Greater than 3 years
    2 = 2-3 years
    3 = 1-2 years 
    4 = 6 months to 1 year
    5 = Less than 6 months

  8. Architecture (Data) - for each workload, assign a value fo each of the criteria below

   Structured Magnitude - The fewer the number of data objects the easier to migrate.
   1 = Millions of objects and Greater
   3 = Hundreds of thousands of Objects
   5 = Tens of Thousands of Objects and Fewer  

   Unstructured Requirements - The smaller the quantity the easier to migrate
   1 = Greater than 100 TB
   2 = 10 - 100 TB
   3 = 500 GB - 10 TB
   4 = 5 GB - 500 GB
   5 = Less than 5 GB

   Data Complexity - The fewer number of data sources the easier to migrate.
   1 = Many Data Sources (>10) requiring fuzzy logic to cleanse with no direct DB, API, or ETL available
   3 = Some Data Sources (4-7) requiring straightforward ETLs
   5 = One source, no cleanse required, and direct DB or API available

  9. Architecture (Infrastructure) 

    Hardware Life Expectancy - The shorter the life expectancy the greater the advantages of moving to the cloud.
    1. Greater than 5 years
    2. 3-4 years
    3. 2-3 years
    4. 1-2 years
    5. Less than 1 year

  10. Financial

    Operating Cost - Financials are a crucial component to any project, as with many transformations, cloud migration usually garners financial benefits in order to understand the return on investment (ROI) the current cost must be measured.
    1 = Low, Virtually no op costs
    2 = Med Low, No SLAs, Minimal staffing
    3 = Med, Moderate SLAs, Minimal staffing
    4 = Med High, High SLAs, some staffing
    5 = High, High SLAs, recovery,  large staffing
    
  11. Risks
    Organizational - How prepared is the organizational unit with Cloud management?
    1 = Catastrophic: Org is unaware and unprepared
    2 = Net loss: Org is unprepared
    3 = Break-even: Org is partially ready
    4 = Marginal: Weak alignment to strategy
    5 = None: Aligns with strategy and org is prepared

    Business Criticality of the Workload - The less critical the application is to the business the easier the justification to migrate.

    1 = Mission Critical
    2 = Above Average
    3 = Average Support
    4 = Minimal Support
    5 = Non-Essential

    Technical Risk - The more aligned the application architecture is to cloud the easier it is to migrate and the less risk incurred.

    1 = Catastrophic: Grave dependency or encryption issues
    2 = Net loss:  Key incompatibilities
    3 = Break-even: Moderate incompatibilities
    4 = Marginal: New technologies
    5 = None: Perfect architectural fit

    Resource Risk - The more skilled the staff is with current app and cloud technologies the easier to migrate.

    1 = Catastrophic: No required staff
    2 = Net loss
    3 = Break-even: Staff skilled with cloud technology, but not current application
    4 = Marginal
    5 = None: Staff has intimate understanding of the current application and cloud technology

    Contractual Risk - A workload whose move to the cloud would put enterprise contracts and business at risk, is not a good fit for the cloud.

    1 = Catastrophic: Puts enterprise contracts at risk
    2 = Net loss
    3 = Break-even: Puts contracts, with significant investment, at risk
    4 = Marginal
