# Segmenting your Workloads by Cloud Model - draft

After having profiled the workloads in the portfolio, you will understand which ones are suitable for the cloud.  However,there is still a need to determine which cloud service model is best suited for that workload (application).  This is done by Segmenting Applications per Cloud Service Model.  

## Guidance

Gartner has identified five options for migrating applications to a cloud environment.

*	Rehost (IaaS)
*	Refactor/Revise (IaaS/PaaS)
*	Rebuild (PaaS)
*	Replace (SaaS)

We want to know which alternative best suits each workload.

(may want to insert a table here)
# When is a workload a candidate for Rehost? (IaaS)
* The system admin team can assemble a VM image with full application stack and configure the necessary hardware.
* Third party software can be run in the VM and is supported by the vendor.
* The application has a "thin client" form factor.
* The application does not require modernization.

# When is a workload a candiate for Refactor/Revise? (IaaS/PaaS)
* The development team can recompile and repackage the application from existing source code.
* The demands for this function or business requirements are not rapidly changing.
* The application is not required with extremely short time-to-market deadline.

# When is a workload a candidate for Rebuild? (PaaS)
* Code or framework lock-in is an acceptable risk.
* The organization is not small vendor risk averse.

# When is a workload a candidate for Replace (SaaS)
* Business users are prepared to modify their business processes.
* The application requires a trivial level of process integration or customization.
* Preserving data semantics is not a priority.


## Preparation

For each workload being assessed gather the following information:Â 

  1. Rehost
     
     VM Image Assembly
     Yes = The system admin team can assemble a VM image with full application stack and configure the necessary hardware.
     No= The system admin team cannot assemble a VM image and configure the necessary hardware.
     
     3rd Party SW in VM
     Yes = Third party software can be run in the VM and is supported by the vendor.
     No = Third party software cannot be run in the VM and is not supported by the vendor or license agreements.

     Fat-client Form Factor
     Yes = The application has a "fat client" form factor.
     No = The application has a "thin client" form factor.

     Modernization Required
     Yes = The application requires modernization.
     No = The application does not require modernization.

  2. Refactor/Revise

     Existing Source Code
     Yes = The development team can recompile and repackage the application from existing source code.
     No = The develop team cannot recompile and repackage the application from existing source code.

     Functional Change
     Yes = The demands for this function or business requirements are rapidly changing.
     No = The demands for this function or business requirements are not rapidly changing.

     Time-to-Market
     Yes = The application is required with extremely short time-to-market deadline.
     No = The application is not required with extremely short time-to-market deadline.
     
  3. Rebuild
     
     Lock-in Unacceptability
     Yes = Code or framework lock-in is an unacceptable risk.
     No = Code or framework lock-in is an acceptable risk.

     Small Vendor Aversion
     Yes = The organization is small vendor risk averse.
     No = The organization is not small vendor risk averse.

  4. Replace
     
     Change-Ready Business
     Yes = Business users are prepared to modify their business processes.
     No = Business users are not prepared to modify their business processes.

     Non-Trivial Process Integration
     Yes = The application requires a non-trivial level of process integration or customization.
     No = The application requires a trivial level of process integration or customization.

     Data Semantics
     Yes = Preserving data semantics is a priority.
     No = Preserving data semantics is not a priority.



## Procedure

Use this procedure to determine which cloud service model a workload should be migrated to:

   1. Open the same file you downloaded in Profiling-your-Workloads
   
   2. Fill out the Segment Applications worksheet with the information gathered in the Preparation section.
   
   3. Save the file
