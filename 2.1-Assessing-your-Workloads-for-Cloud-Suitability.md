# Assessing your Workloads for Cloud Suitability

One of the most significant activities in any cloud migration is examining the application portfolio to help determine cloud migration plans. This activity will likely be iterated many times as new cloud capabilities emerge and new cloud candidates are revealed. Organizations therefore need a streamlined, repeatable, and effective process for portfolio assessment.

The specific approach an organization uses to assess the portfolio for cloud readiness will depend heavily on a number of factors, including:

* The business motivations for performing a portfolio assessment
* The architectural principles for performing a portfolio assessment
* Existing capabilities in application portfolio management (APM) and cloud computing
* Existing methodologies used to perform and govern APM

This section discusses how each of these factors can impact how APM is performed.

Microsoft has developed a number of tools to help drive the processes of making decisions about the application portfolio and approaches to cloud computing based on business drivers. These are detailed in this section.

## Guidance

There are two fundamental ways in which business drivers and needs influence the results of an application portfolio assessment for cloud readiness.

* Business motivations influence how portfolio decisions are made and these decisions drive which cloud capabilities are 
  adopted
* Business motivations influence the future cloud state, which provides different options for the application portfolio 
  future state

In Defining-a-Cloud-Strategy, we identify the objectives for going to the Cloud.  These objectives form the business motivations that drive which cloud capabilities will be adopted and which cloud models will be assigned to workloads.

For example, cloud-specific principles could include favoring public cloud over private cloud, or choosing software as a service (SaaS) solutions over platform as a service (PaaS), or PaaS over infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

A set of cloud-specific architectural principles helps provide a concrete context for portfolio assessment, but it is essential to link these principles back clearly to the business drivers and needs, or the rationale for the decision making will be lost. It is also important to note that different architectural principles can apply to different segments of the portfolio.
